# Downloading data
Download the data using the ff. link and unzip the data into your working directory
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

A description of the data is available at the site from which the data is obtained
<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

# Breakdown of code sections
#### Getting and reading 'train' and 'test' tables 
Set the proper working directory for the training and test data using the `getwd` and `paste` functions. For this script, I unzipped the downloaded data and transferred the folder *UCI HAR Dataset* to my working directory
Using the `read.table` function, the test and training data are read from the working directory

#### Assigning names to the tables
Assigned descriptive column names using the `features` table and the `colnames` function

#### Merging the data
Used the `cbind` functions to merge the training data; namely the `y_train`, `sub_train` and `X_train` tables under the `all_train` table and the `y_test`, `sub_test` and `X_test` tables under the `all_test` table.

Used the `rbind` function to merge both training and test data into the `setforMeanandStd` table

#### Getting the mean and standard deviation columns + merge with activity labels
Used the `grepl` function in conjunction with the OR operator ("|" character) to find which columns have the mean and standard deviation along with the `subjectID` and `activityID` columns which will be used to identify the observations in the final data set

After which the `merge` function is used to merge the activity labels table and the filtered mean + standard deviation table using the activityID as the key

#### Writing the final table into a .txt file
Using the `dplyr` package and its `group_by` and `summarize_all` functions to create the final data set
`group_by` was used to group the table using the activityID and subjectID
`summarize_all` was used to apply the `mean` function to the rest of the columns

# Description of tables
#### X_test/train, y_test/train, sub_test/train, features, act_labels
Testing/training data from the downloaded data

#### all_train, all_test, finalset
`all_train` and `all_test` are the binded data from their x, y and subject counterparts respectively
`finalset` is the combined data set from `all_train` and `all_test`

#### mean_and_std, setforMeanandStd
`mean_and_std` is a vector generated by the `grepl` function to determine which columns contain mean and standard deviation data. This vector is used to subset `finalset`, generating the `setforMeanandStd` data frame

#### finalset2
Using the `dplyr` operations `group_by` and `summarize_all` in conjunction with the pipeline operator ("%>%") to group the `setforMeanandStd` table by subjectID and activityID. Then the `mean` function is applied using the `summarize_all` function
